# Title: Exploring Frequency-Based Text Generation

## Grade: Year 9

## Objective:

Students will gain an understanding of frequency-based text generation, including its principles, techniques, and limitations. They will also engage in a hands-on activity to create their own frequency-based generated text.

## Duration: 60 minutes

## Materials:

1. Computers or tablets with internet access

2. Projector or smartboard for whole-class instruction

3. Handouts with instructions for the activity (optional)

## Lesson Plan:

1. Introduction (5 minutes)

   a. Begin the lesson by asking students if they have heard of frequency-based text generation or word-based models. Write down their responses on the board.

   b. Explain that frequency-based text generation involves analyzing a given dataset to identify word frequencies and patterns, allowing the creation of new text based on these frequencies.

2. What is Frequency-Based Text Generation? (10 minutes)

   a. Show a brief video or provide a slideshow presentation to introduce students to frequency-based text generation. Explain key concepts such as word frequencies, n-grams, and language modeling.

   b. Discuss the purpose of frequency-based text generation, including its applications in text prediction, autocomplete suggestions, and generating coherent text based on patterns in existing text.

3. How Frequency-Based Text Generation Works (15 minutes)

   a. Explain the basic working principles of frequency-based text generation:

   i. Corpus analysis: Introduce the concept of a corpus, a large collection of text used for analysis. Explain how the corpus is processed to identify word frequencies and patterns.

   ii. Markov chains: Describe how Markov chains are used to model the relationships between words based on their frequency and proximity in the text.

   iii. Text generation: Demonstrate how the model uses the identified patterns to generate new text by predicting the most likely word or phrase to follow a given context.

   b. Clarify that frequency-based text generation relies on statistical analysis rather than understanding meaning or context.

4. Limitations of Frequency-Based Text Generation (10 minutes)

   a. Engage the students in a discussion about the limitations of frequency-based text generation, such as:

   i. Lack of semantic understanding: Frequency-based models do not grasp the meaning behind the words and may produce text that appears grammatically correct but lacks coherence or relevance.

   ii. Over-reliance on training data: The quality and diversity of the training data greatly affect the output, and biases present in the data can be reflected in the generated text.

   iii. Difficulty with rare or unseen words: Frequency-based models struggle with generating text involving uncommon or context-specific words not present in the training corpus.

   b. Encourage critical thinking and discussion on how these limitations can impact the usefulness and reliability of frequency-based text generation.

5. Hands-on Activity: Create Your Own Frequency-Based Generated Text (20 minutes)

   a. Instruct students to access an online tool or use provided software for frequency-based text generation (recommend a tool or website).

   b. Provide a sample corpus or a small dataset of text for students to analyze and generate text from.

   c. Ask students to experiment with the tool and generate a piece of text.

   d. Allow time for students to share their generated text with the class and discuss the output.

6. Conclusion and Reflection (5 minutes)

   a. Summarize the key points discussed during the lesson.

   b. Ask students to reflect on what they have learned about frequency-based text generation and its limitations compared to other approaches.

   c. Address any remaining questions or concerns.

## Extension Activities (optional):

1. Research Project: Assign students to research and compare frequency-based text generation with other approaches like neural language models or rule-based systems.

2. Algorithmic Poetry: Have students explore using frequency-based text generation
