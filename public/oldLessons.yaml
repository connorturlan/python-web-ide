    By using a single '=' you can assign a value to a label called a Variable.
    This allows you to use names in your code to reference values later in your program!
    You can assign values to labels by using:
    $apple = 0
    $banana = 'fruit'
    $cucumber = 100.0
    Change the values on the left to be 1, 2, and 3 in order.
  example: |
    a = 0
    b = 2
    c = 8

    print(a, b, c)
